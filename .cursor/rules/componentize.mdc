Componentize means to extract a component or a part of a component into a separate file.

When componentizing react components, follow these rules:

IMPORTANT:

- File names should be in kebab-case
- Prioritize putting the props type "inline", like such:
- If the user did not specify a folder or path, put it in the same folder as the current component

```tsx
export function Component({ prop }: { prop: string }) {
  return <div>{prop}</div>;
}
```
